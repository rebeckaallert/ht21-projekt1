                Founded in 2021, West Coast Bubble started its mission to combine two cultures from across 
                the world. By combining Taiwanese bubble tea with the taste of classic Swedish seafood, 
                the founders created a culinary experience that can’t be described in words. With the use of 
                caviar and roe as the classic boba pearls, milk from our local Swedish cows, and tea seasoned 
                with a distinctive fish taste, there are millions of possible combinations to be made.<br> 
            </p>   

            <p class="brödtext">
                We believe that good drinks should be good for you, your wallet, and the environment. 
                That’s why we want to make sure our carbon footprint is as small as possible. We teamed up 
                with a group of local fishermen so we could provide the finest fish with the least amount of 
                environmental impact possible. <br>
            </p>

            <p class="brödtext">
                Our drinks are 100% sugar-free and filled with tons of vitamins and minerals, specifically 
                Vitamin D and Vitamin B12, both essential for a healthy lifestyle and helping you stay 
                focused and energised for the entire day. <br>
            </p>

            <p class="brödtext">
                We offer vegan options as well, with seaweed caviar as a substitute for the roe. The milk 
                is made by our lovely partners over at Oatly™.
